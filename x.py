use_pdf = f"""Ensuring compliance with regulatory authorities such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and the Income Tax Department is crucial for companies operating in India. Adherence to the latest guidelines helps avoid penalties and maintain operational integrity. Below are general policies and guidelines updated to reflect current compliance criteria:

1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI):

Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Standards: Companies must implement robust KYC procedures to verify customer identities and monitor transactions to prevent money laundering. Non-compliance can result in significant penalties. For instance, the RBI imposed a ₹70 lakh penalty on a bank for non-compliance with KYC norms. ​

Reporting to Credit Information Companies: Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) are required to standardize their credit bureau reporting to ensure accurate reflection of borrowers' credit histories. This harmonization aids in consistent credit reporting across financial entities. ​

2. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI):

Due Diligence for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs): Fund managers must exercise stringent due diligence to prevent circumvention of regulations, including practices like "evergreening" stressed loans. SEBI mandates a thorough review of large investors and requires government approval for investors from countries sharing land borders with India. ​
